Born and raised in [Surat, India](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surat){:target="_blank"}, I am a computer engineer, graduated from [Sarvajanik College of Engineering and Technology](http://www.scet.ac.in){:target="_blank"}.

Along with studying computer engineering, I've built android and web applications during past 4 years. I love open source things and code wise, JavaScript (Node.js), C, C++, Java, and PHP are my languages of choice. You can view my open source repositories on [Github @{{ site.author.github.username }}]({{ site.author.github.link }}){:target="_blank"}.

In my free time, I will most likely be out for photographing nature and sceneries, hanging out with my fantastic friends, or out enjoying a meal.

You can contact me via [Twitter @{{ site.author.twitter.username }}]({{ site.author.twitter.link }}){:target="_blank"} (or [Email]({{ site.author.email.id | prepend:'mailto:' }}){:rel="nofollow"}).

Thanks for reading!
